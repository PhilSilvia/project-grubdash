# GrubDash Backend Server
Welcome to GrubDash, your one-stop solution for managing orders and restaurants! GrubDash is a mock backend server designed to simulate the functionality of popular food delivery services like Grubhub or Doordash. Whether you're a developer looking to practice building front-end interfaces or just curious about how these platforms work behind the scenes, GrubDash is here to help.

# Features
GrubDash offers several key features to help you understand and simulate the workings of a food delivery service:

* Order Management: Handle incoming orders, track their status, and update customers in real-time.
* Delivery Management: Simulate the process of assigning and tracking delivery drivers for orders.
* Dishes Management: Track pricing, image, and description information for multiple dishes to be tracked across orders.

# Front-End

Ties into the GrubDash front-end project which can be found here: https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end. 

# Future Improvements

There's plenty of opportunity for expanded features down the road, including:

* Restaurant Management: Manage restaurants, including their menu items, opening hours, and location.
* User Authentication: Securely manage user accounts, authentication, and authorization.

# Acknowledgements
GrubDash was inspired by the need for a simple, yet comprehensive, mock backend server for food delivery applications. We would like to thank all the contributors who have helped improve this project and especially Thinkful Coding Bootcamp (https://www.thinkful.com/) for the opportunity to work on this project.
